Exercise 5: Using GitHub Copilot for Code Refactoring
Duration: 40 minutes

GitHub code refactoring refers to the process of restructuring and improving the quality of code in a GitHub repository without changing its external behaviour. Code refactoring aims to enhance readability, maintainability, and performance while reducing technical debt and potential bugs.

In this exercise, you will participate in a learning or practice activity where your main goal will be to use GitHub Copilot for code refactoring using the C# programming language. You will also be generating unit test functions using GitHub Copilot Chat.

Disclaimer: GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body or code in gray text. Examples of what you'll most likely see in this lab, but the exact suggestion may vary.

Task 1: Understand the code already available for you.
Installing C Sharp (C#) extension in VS Code
To install the C Sharp (C#) extension, the following steps are to be performed within Visual Studio Code:

Click on the Extensions (1) icon in the activity bar present on the left side of the Visual Studio Code Window.
In the "Search Extensions in Marketplace" search box, type and search for the C# (2) extension.
Select C# (3) from the list of results that show up.
Click on the Install (4) button.

To demonstrate the GitHub code refactor, let us take an example of a poorly written code and analyze it. The below code is written using the C# programming language.


Task 2: Use GitHub Copilot to refactor the code
Now, let's use the GitHub Copilot Chat feature to refactor the above code.

Click on the Chat extension icon from the activity bar in the left navigation pane. This opens the GitHub Copilot Chat window into which the above code is to be pasted.

Type the prompt Refactor the code at the end of the code and then press enter.

The GitHub Copilot Chat will give the response as shown below.

Task 5: Create unit test functions
From the codespace in the VS Code Explorer window, create a new file.



Name the file test.js as shown below:



Now, navigate to the GitHub Copilot Chat and give the prompt Compose a full JavaScript program for constructing a calculator.

The GitHub Copilot Chat will generate the code as shown below.



Copy and paste the code in the file named test.js that you just created.

Now, to generate test cases for each function, select the function for which the test case has to be generated, and back in the GitHub Copilot Chat window, type /tests and hit enter.



It will generate a test case for the add function.



Congratulations on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:

Navigate to the Lab Validation Page, from the upper right corner in the lab guide section.
Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.

Summary
In this exercise, you have successfully employed GitHub Copilot to carry out code refactoring tasks and created unit test functions. Code refactoring with Copilot's assistance will make your coding projects more efficient and collaborative.
